# hello-world
Whats up world! Check out my repository, isn't it great.

I enjoy long walks on the beach, controlled chaos and living in the middle of nowhere. I enjoy HTML and CSS.
I secretly wish I could be a chef, because I love food. I think I like eating food more than creating it though. 
I think I'll stick with computers.
